### 문제 설명

<p>Anna and Bob are starting up a new high-tech company. Of course, one of their key considerations is choosing a good name for the company. Palindromes are cool. (A palindrome is a word that is the same when reversed, like the names of our two entrepreneurs.) They would really the name of their company to be a palindrome. Unfortunately, they cannot think of a nifty company name that is also a palindrome.</p>

<p>Maybe at least the telephone number of their company could be a palindrome. However, they really want their customers to be able to call them, so they want to choose the company name so that, when it is typed using the letters printed on a phone keypad, the result is also their phone number. (On a standard phone keypad, the following keys contain the corresponding letters: 2: ABC, 3: DEF, 4: GHI, 5: JKL, 6: MNO, 7: PQRS, 8: TUV, 9: WXYZ.)</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of lines to follow. Each following line contains a company name, which is a string of at most 20 letters, which may be either uppercase or lowercase.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each company name, print a single line of output, containing the word YES if the phone number is a palindrome, or NO if it is not.</p>
