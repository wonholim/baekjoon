### 문제 설명

<p>You are organizing a marathon with N runners. Every runner is given a distinct number from 1 to N, so they can be easily identified.</p>

<p>You record the number of each runner as they cross the finish line. Unfortunately, you notice that only N − 1 runners have finished. Which runner is still out there?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2<sup>15</sup>). The next line contains N −1 distinct integers in the range from 1 to N, representing the numbers of runners who have crossed the finish line.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the number of the runner who has not crossed the finish line.</p>
