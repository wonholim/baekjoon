### 문제 설명

<p>Dr. Orooji’s twins (Mack and Zack) play soccer. We will assume Mack wears jersey number 18 and Zack wears 17. So, Dr. O has to look for these two numbers when trying to find the twins.</p>

<p>Given a list of 10 numbers, determine if the twins are there.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of data sets to check. The sets are on the following n input lines, one set per line. Each set consists of exactly 10 single-space-separated distinct integers (each integer between 11 and 99 inclusive) giving the jersey numbers for the players.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print each input set. Then, on the next output line, print one of four messages (mack, zack, both, none), indicating how many of the twins are in the set. Leave a blank line after the output for each test case.</p>
