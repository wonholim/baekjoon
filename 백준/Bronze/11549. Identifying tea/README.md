The participants must smell, taste and assess the sample so as to identify the tea type, which can be: (1) white tea; (2) green tea; (3) black tea; or (4) herbal tea. At the end, the answers are checked to determine the number of correct guesses.</p>

<p>Given the actual tea type and the answers provided, determine the number of contestants who got the correct answer.</p>
