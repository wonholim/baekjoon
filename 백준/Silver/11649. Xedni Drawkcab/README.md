### 문제 설명

<p>For years, before computers, Merriam Webster maintained a Backward Index of all of the words in the English language. They had all of the words on cards, one word per card, backwards. The cards were alphabetized. This was very useful, before computers, to determine such things as 'How many words end with 'TION'?'</p>

<p>Given a list of words consisting of only capital letters, create a Backward Index by reversing them and printing the reversals in alphabetical order.</p>
