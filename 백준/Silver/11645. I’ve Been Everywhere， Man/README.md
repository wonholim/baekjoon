### 문제 설명

<p>Alice travels a lot for her work. Each time she travels, she visits a single city before returning home.</p>

<p>Someone recently asked her “how many different cities have you visited for work?” Thankfully Alice has kept a log of her trips. Help Alice figure out the number of cities she has visited at least once.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer T ≤ 50 indicating the number of test cases. The first line of each test case also contains a single positive integer n indicating the number of work trips Alice has taken so far. The following n lines describe these trips. The ith such line simply contains the name of the city Alice visited on her ith trip.</p>

<p>Alice’s work only sends her to cities with simple names: city names only contain lowercase letters, have at least one letter, and do not contain spaces.</p>

<p>The number of trips is at most 100 and no city name contains more than 20 characters.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, simply output a single line containing a single integer that is the number of distinct cities that Alice has visited on her work trips.</p>
