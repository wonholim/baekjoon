### 문제 설명

<p>The herd has run its first marathon!  The N (1 <= N <= 5,000) times have been posted in the form of Hours (0 <= Hours <= 99), Minutes (0 <= Minutes <= 59), and Seconds (0 <= Seconds <= 59). Bessie must sort them (by Hours, Minutes, and Seconds) into ascending order, smallest times first.</p>

<p>Consider a simple example with times from a smaller herd of just 3 cows (note that cows do not run 26.2 miles so very quickly):</p>

<pre>    11:20:20
    11:15:12
    14:20:14</pre>

<p>The proper sorting result is:</p>

<pre>    11:15:12
    11:20:20
    14:20:14</pre>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer: N</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains cow i's time as three space-separated integers: Hours, Minutes, Seconds</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Lines 1..N: Each line contains a cow's time as three space-separated integers</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
