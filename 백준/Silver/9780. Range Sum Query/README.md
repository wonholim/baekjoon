### 문제 설명

<p>Given a list L containing n integers, find the Range Sum Query (RSQ) between index i and j, inclusive, i.e. RSQ(i, j) = L[i] + L[i+1] + L[i+2] + ... + L[j].</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input starts with an integer t in the first line that denotes the number of test cases in this problem (1 ≤ t ≤ 5).</p>

<p>Each test case starts with a blank line, followed by a line that contains 2 integers: n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 100,000).</p>

<p>Then, the next line contains n non-negative integers up to 1,000,000,000.</p>

<p>Then q lines follow.</p>

<p>Each line contains two integers, i and j (0 ≤ i, j < 10,000).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each query, print a line containing the value of RSQ(i, j). Separate two test cases with a blank line.</p>
